 transform `U_i` into `X_i`.

# 1,  Exercise 3

In the exercise you can use a build in procedure for generating uniform random variables. Compare the results obtained in simulations with expected results. Use histograms (and tests).

Choose a value for p in the geometric distribution and simulate 10,000 outcomes.

Simulate the 6 point distribution with

- by applying a direct (crude) method
- by using the the rejction method
- by using the Alias method

Verify the results by comparing histograms with analytical results and erform tests for distribution type.

## 1.1,  Pareto Distribution

Pareto distribution, with `beta = 1` and experiment with different values of k values: `k = 2.05`, `k = 2.5`, `k = 3` or `k = 4`.
