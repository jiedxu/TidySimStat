# Introduction to Math-Sim, Statistics and Likelihood

> A simulation study is usually undertaken to determine the value of some quantity \(\theta\) connected with a particular stochastic model. A simulation of the relevant system results in the output data \(X,\) a random variable whose expected value is the quantity of interest \(\theta .\) A second independent simulation - that is, a second simulation run provides a new and independent random variable having mean \(\theta .\) This continues until we have amassed a total of \(k\) runs-and the \(k\) independent random variables \(X_{1}, \ldots, X_{k}-\) all of which are identically distributed with mean \(\theta .\) The average of these \(k\) values, \(\bar{X}=\sum_{i=1}^{k} X_{i} / k,\) is then used as an estimator, or approximator, of \(\theta\).
