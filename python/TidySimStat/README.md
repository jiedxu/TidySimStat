# TidySimStat in Python: Stochastic Simulation and Statistics

## Settings

- for discrete random variables
  * index `k` and number of possible values `K`: k = 1, 2, 3, ..., K
  * index for lists in Python `i`: i = 0, 1, 2, ...

## Unit Testing



## Programming Tips

> Oftentimes by choosing suitable values we can reduce the simulation model to one that can be evaluated analytically or that has been previously extensively studied, so as to compare our simulated results with known answers. [@ross2012simulation]

> A useful technique when searching for errors in the computer program is to utilise a trace. In a trace, the state variable, the event list, and the counter variables are all printed out after each event occurs. This allows one to follow the simulated system over time so as to determine when it is not performing as intended. [@ross2012simulation]
